# Flask Blog Web App

A lightweight Flask web application that retrieves and displays blog data from an external API. The project includes two routes: one for showcasing a list of blog entries and another for dynamically generating individual blog posts. It serves as a practical demonstration of Flask fundamentals, API integration, and proper static file linking.
